# cwl-formatter

A shiny app to format Common Workflow Language (CWL) apps using the Python package cwlformat.

## Dependencies

This app uses [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to call Python and the Python package [cwlformat](https://pypi.org/project/cwlformat/). Follow its readme to install the Python package either using pip or from GitHub.

After the Python package is installed, modify `.Rprofile` to give a hint to reticulate on where to find Python and the installed package. The default location is for a macOS Homebrew Python 3. Relaunch the RStudio session to use this profile.

If you encountered an error on unable to import the Python module, please consult the articles [Python Version Configuration](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html) and [Installing Python Packages](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html), then add a few lines to `server/wrapper.R` before `reticulate::import` to help reticulate locate the Python package. For example, if we use virtualenv:

```r
use_python("/your/path/to/bin/python3")

virtualenv_create("venv", python = "/your/path/to/bin/python3")
virtualenv_install("venv", packages = c("cwlformat"), ignore_installed = FALSE)
use_virtualenv("venv", required = TRUE)
```
